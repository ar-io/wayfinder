# What is it?
WayFinder is a simple, open source, Google Chrome extension that intelligently routes users to optimal AR.IO gateways, ensuring streamlined access to the permaweb on Arweave.

# Who is it built for?
WayFinder was built for the general purpose user who wants to find named data on the Permaweb.  Since no wallet is needed, the user does not have to have ever touched tokens or even uploaded data.
